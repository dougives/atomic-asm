A LICENSE:

- free (as in, at no cost) for personal, non-profit use without distribution.
- for anything other use, leave an issue or pull request with contact information, and we can work out the terms.

fyi: i will probably grant free open source projects what they require without any consideration. but again, the terms of such a license must be worked out before use.
